#Task 3: Use an expression to calculate the area of a rectangle (length * width).

# Assign values for length and width
length = 20
width = 8

Area = length * width #Expression to calculate area

#Display results
print (f"If the length of rectangle = {length}m and the width = {width}m, then its area becomes: {Area}m^2")
