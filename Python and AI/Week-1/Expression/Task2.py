#Task 2: Combine a string variable with another string using concatenation.

#Method 1 - Store string characters in two different variables
string1 = "Hey!"
string2 = "This is me, Taneesha."

#Concatenate them and store in a variable 'join'
join = string1 + " " + string2 

#print 'join' to check results
print(join)

#Method 2 - Store string data in different variable and directly print it.
string1 = "Hey!"
string2 = "This is me, Taneesha."

print(string1 + " " + string2) #display results
